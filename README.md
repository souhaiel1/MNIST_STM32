 Along with the deepening development in communication technologies and the surge of mobile devices, Edge Computing, is surging in popularity.  Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are thriving with the breakthroughs in deep learning and the upgrade of hardware architectures. Billions of bytes of data, generated at the network edge, put    great demands on data processing and structural optimization. Therefore, there exists a strong demand to integrate Edge Computing and AI, which gives birth to Edge Intelligence.  
This project explores this concept and offers an MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition model desiged to run on STM32F429I Disco board. The model is a CNN built using Keras anf TF2 and compressed and generated using X-Cube-AI.

 ## Hardware 
 
 This project is built using STM32CubeIDE and tested on STM32F429I-DISCO baord , but it can be easly modifed to be used on any STM32F4 board.
